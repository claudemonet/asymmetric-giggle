Class project to automatically schedule student course selection. Attempted to assign students to courses, while not allowing course schedule conflicts (e.g., a student can't take two classes at the same time).

Some graph theory and graph coloring. Various algorithmic considerations. The validity of this approach remains to be seen.

This code should most likely not be used by anyone.
